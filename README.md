# Expense Tracking System
Expense Tracking System, as a part of the DBMS Mini Project.
Problem Statement 
Nowadays, people earn both active and passive income, but are unaware of how to manage their 
income efficiently. Many people, especially those who live on a budget require some method to 
maintain their daily expenses and assess their spending habits. For this purpose, we can construct a 
management system that enables users to do the same. 

Introduction 
The Expense Tracking System is an application that enables users to sign up and create an account, log 
their income and expenses under different categories, view their expenses as charts, and also 
generate a report on their expenses. The ETS will keep track of the income - expense of a person on a 
daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis as per the userâ€™s requirements. 

Abstract 
The Expense Tracking System consists of the following: 

A. User Registration, Login and Setup 

a. User can create an account with a username and password. 
b. They can then login to the same account and preserve their data. 
c. They can define the categories of income and expenses during registration (which can be 
modified later on). 
d. User can add multiple wallets/bank accounts/cards and split their resources accordingly 
(they can add more later on). 

B. Add Income 

a. User has to select the wallet they wish to add income to. 
b. They can then insert income into a category they have defined earlier, or log it under a 
new category. 
c. User is also provided the option to delete any income added. 
d. They can also set a recurring income to be added daily/weekly/monthly/yearly. 

C. Add Expenses 

a. User has to select the wallet that they had made the expense from. 
b. They then have to add the expense into a category defined earlier, or log it under a newly 
created category. 
c. User can also delete any expenses they have added. 

D. Budgeting 

a. User can set a monthly budget for both overall or a certain category of expenses. 
b. They will be alerted if the expenses exceed any of these limits. 
c. User can create account group and set a fixed amount to be allocated to these accounts 
daily/weekly/monthly/yearly (eg: Retirement, EMI payments, Rent, etc). 

E. Data Visualization 

a. User is able to view the average, minimum, maximum and sum of their expenses under 
each category, account group or in total. 
b. User can view daily/weekly/monthly/yearly expenses in different categories as a pie chart. 
c. Total expenses day by day/week by week/ month by month/year by year can be viewed in 
the form of bar graph or line graph along the timeline. 
d. User can view their remaining balance under each category or each account group. 

F. Data Search and Retrieval 

a. User can enter specific date/month/year and retrieve the income-expense information for 
that period. 
b. User can export their data in the form of .csv files. 

G. Gratuity Calculator 

a. Calculates an estimate of the gratuity that user will receive at the end of the service.
